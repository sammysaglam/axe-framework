# Axe.cc Rapid-Development PHP Framework

Hi! Welcome to Axe.cc — v0.1!

Visit the website at www.axe.cc

Note: Though usable in production environments, functionality & documentation is currently limited — but no worries, I'm actively working on it!

This HMVC framework is targeted for mainly for freelancers, with the aim of saving development time with its pre-bundled modules. The aim is to reuse the module in multiple projects.

Let me know of any modules you create, or create a pull-request on any modifications to the core modules, as I would like to add any useful ones the core framework.

# Modular

Each module extends functionality of Axe Framework, and prevents you from needing to rewrite modules. Current bundled modules include:

* Auth – Authentication system, allowing user-groups.
* Website – To create websites, and to allow placing of assets in your view folders; as opposed to the public_html folder in other frameworks.
* DesignPackage – Image assets (e.g. social media icons, and more coming soon...) + a CSS Framework for aligning (horizontal & vertical! — using CSS Flex of course); grid system; magic-tiles; is-loading rotating; maintain-aspect-ratio; and, a stock ticker.
* [EditableContent](https://github.com/sammysaglam/editable-content) – a React Component, WYSIWYG editor, adapted for Axe.cc. You can assign priveleges  based on user-groups, and allows your clients to edit their pages in WYSIWYG style.
* [AxeComments](https://github.com/sammysaglam/axe-comments) – a React Component, which allows commenting and voting/downvoting.
* ContactForm – A simple JavaScript contact form for websites.
